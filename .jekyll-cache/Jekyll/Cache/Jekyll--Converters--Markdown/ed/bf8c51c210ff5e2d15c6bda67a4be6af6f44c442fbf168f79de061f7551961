I"Ð<p>Ah, our good olâ€™ friend, the calculator. Whether loading some dubious games at home onto your TI-84 or making sure you havenâ€™t lost your grasp on reality by punching in 2 + 2, your calculator has always been there to support you every step of the way. Sometimes, though, you might wonder at the exceptional amount of complexity stored into a (relatively) small device - how does it fit that admittedly shoddy but playable Tetris game into that medley of wires and electronic circuits? How can it tell me what 1/(7 * sqrt(2pi)) * e^(-0.5 * (x - 3) / 7)^2 is in a matter of milliseconds? To answer these questions and many other curiosities regarding our humble calculator, let us dive deep into its mechanics.</p>
