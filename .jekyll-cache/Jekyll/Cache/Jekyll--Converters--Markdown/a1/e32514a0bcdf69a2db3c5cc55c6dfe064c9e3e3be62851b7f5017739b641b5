I"È<p>Itâ€™s worth thinking about why we learn math in school; many high schools
require a full 4 years of math for graduation. But one may argue that
not all professions will actually use math on a regular basis â€“ which
is true, many fields donâ€™t use math as a problem-solving tool. But many
important professions do use math, and learning how to think logically
is still an invaluable skill, even if your career path does not directly
involve math.</p>
